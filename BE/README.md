# About Our Project:

In this digitally evolved era, almost everyone, from celebrities to the common man, is using different social media channels, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, to stay connected with their friends, relatives, and followers. In fact, most of the people are now addicted and are literally living in the world of social media.
Our aim is to make a social media app ChitChat .We refer Instagram for its features. 
Like most social media apps, ChitChat allows you to follow users that youâ€™re interested in. This creates a feed on the homepage showing recent posts from everyone you follow. You can Like posts and comment on them.
In addition to posting normal photos and videos, which stay on your page permanently, ChitChat also supports Stories.  Stories allow you to post one or more photos and video clips in a series. Anyone can view these for 24 hours, after which they expire.
Aside from this, ChitChat also supports direct messaging so you can chat with friends in private. You can also explore profiles to see what else you might have interest in.
